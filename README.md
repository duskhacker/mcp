"Media CoPy"

Simple Go program to copy/move media files (files with extensions ```jpg$,png,avi,mov,tiff```) in an
arbitrarily deeply nested set of directories to some destination directory, adding a numeric addition
to the base filename if the name already exists in the destination.

Pretty much just a learning toy.
